Contrary to perception, India offers high-quality, cost-effective cancer care, especially when done smartly 
Dr. Singhal explains:
• Lower overall costs: Hospital & surgeon fees are 30–60% lower than in Western countries—but import costs of robotics raise those cases’ price.
• Efficient treatment models: Less hospitalization, fewer complications, and package deals (labs + scans + drugs) reduce hidden costs.
• Insurance coverage: Many domestic policies now cover HIPEC and robotic procedures. His center helps with claim processing.
• Value-based care: Shorter recovery times translate into earlier return to work/life—economically and emotionally beneficial.
• Transparent planning: Quote systems, financial counseling ensure patients know cost breakdowns; no surprise bills.
In summary, he argues that “affordable” doesn’t mean sub-par—it can mean cost-efficiency with top-tier outcomes and compassion.
